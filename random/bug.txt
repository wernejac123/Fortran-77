my DRAND() subroutine never generates the number 1 so its actually 0 to less than 1.
to compensate for this, DINT() could be used instead of INT(), which rounds up or down depending on if its greater than or less than .5
this would change it so it create numbers in the range of 1 to 10 (if using this code)

The number 0 and 10 occur significantly less than the other numbers, soo this isn't evenly distributed random numbers

I have not eddited the code yet to add this.
