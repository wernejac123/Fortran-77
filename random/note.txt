1) In FORTRAN 77 there is no standard way to generate random numbers (its entirely dependent on compiler extentions)
2) This uses a a method to generate psudo-random numbers using 'Linear Congruence Method'
3) I made it so 200 random numbers in the range of 0-9 (truncated to integers with INT()) are generated 
4) It includes a test that prints the number of occurance of each number (to see how evenly distributed it is)
5) To get truly random numbers the seed needs to change somehow everytime the program is ran; same seed=same results
6) The document I used which has more information of the formula:

 https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/linear-congruence-method-for-generating-pseudo-random-numbers/

7) I don't really know what range the seed needs to be in other than it has to be less than 0xffffffff (which should be the maximum 
value of a 4 byte integer since seed is declared as INTEGER. I would assume (BUT I DON'T KNOW) the seed should probably be less than 
M, but this is purely a guess 

8) Changing the values of A,C,M, and SEED does affect results. 
9) From this test, it appears the random number are DOUBLEPRECISION numbers between 0 to 1, but I can't say for sure if it always stays 
in that range. 
10) This program is purely experimental
